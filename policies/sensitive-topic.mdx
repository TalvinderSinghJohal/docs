## Data Privacy Policy

The Data Privacy Policy is a configurable mechanism designed to protect sensitive and regulated data during interactions with a Language Model (LLM). It ensures that confidential information is not transmitted to and from the LLM, maintaining security and compliance. Organisations have full control over the policy's settings, enabling them to select from a wide range of regulatory frameworks (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS) or create custom configurations tailored to their specific needs selecting from a range of sensitive data types.

### What the Policy Does

- **Purpose**: Protects sensitive and regulated information during LLM interactions and enables compliance with industry regulations while offering custom configuration options.
- **Scope**:
  - **Prompt Configuration**: Governs inputs before they're sent to the LLM
    - Regulation or Custom Entity Selection
    - Operational Modes: Monitor Only / Monitor & Override
    - Prevents sensitive prompts from reaching the LLM
  - **Response Configuration**: Governs outputs returned by the LLM
    - Similar entity and mode options as prompts
    - Prevents non-compliant outputs from being shown to users
- **Key Features**:
  - Regulation presets with predefined entities
  - 52 custom entity options for advanced control

### Why Use This Policy?

#### Benefits
- Enhanced data security
- Regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, CPRA)
- Customisable enforcement options

#### Use Case: Law Firm Scenario

A prominent law firm uses AltrumAI to draft contracts and perform legal research. To ensure compliance and client confidentiality:

- **Prompt Configuration**:
  - Enforces GDPR and CPRA
  - Adds custom detection for names, settlements, etc.
  - Uses **Monitor & Override** to block sensitive prompts
- **Response Configuration**:
  - Initially set to **Monitor Only**
  - Switched to **Monitor & Override** after reviewing risks

This ensures both inputs and outputs are compliant and secure.
